# About

You can find the logical explanation of the layout from this link ( http://www.max-sperling.bplaced.net/?p=10296 ). This approach ensures that the project is organized. What is done in this repo is an example of how the project can be more organized and maintainable with the CMake target name - project folder - c++ namespace trio.

Using this method, you can logically layer the project at the same time in the file system, at the code level and at the build level. And you can only use namespace to go down to the logical layer you want to go down to within the scope you want to go down to. In this way, you can avoid complications and name conflicts in growing projects.
